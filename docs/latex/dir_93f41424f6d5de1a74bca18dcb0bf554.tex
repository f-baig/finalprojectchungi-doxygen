{\bfseries{Rule\+: Everyone on your team earns the same grade for all parts of the project.}}

For Yale graduate students who are taking the course at the 5000 level, the expectation is that your project will have more.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Grad level students will use game engine to make a game with at least \textquotesingle{}4\textquotesingle{} scenes (instead of 3).

5\% (Prototype)


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Did you start your project?
\item We will grade this by checking that you have at least one source file commit by the scheduled date on the calendar.
\end{DoxyItemize}

5\% (Progress Evaluation)

Did you fill out a milestone evaluation (which will be one of your in-\/class activities)?

10\% (30 second video)

Did you submit a 30 second video that showed both your editor(5\%) and your game(5\%) in a runnable state? It doesn\textquotesingle{}t have to be complete, but I should see you briefly show your editor, and then your game loading some data generated from your editor and loaded in your engine.\hypertarget{dir_93f41424f6d5de1a74bca18dcb0bf554_autotoc_md48}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Final Deliverable (80\% of final project grade)}{Final Deliverable (80\% of final project grade)}}\label{dir_93f41424f6d5de1a74bca18dcb0bf554_autotoc_md48}

20\% (Engineering/\+Design Patterns)

On the polish of your final project (did it work as intended, were there bugs, did I have to struggle to get your tool running, was your solution well engineered, were there patterns used, etc.)

20\% (Requirements)

Did you complete all of the requirements regarding having\+: a game engine, a game built, and an editor to help build your game?

5\%\% (Wow Factor)

On the creativity and overall \textquotesingle{}wow\textquotesingle{} factor of your project. Was there a cool feature or surprise that got me excited about the project? Does this project have potential to be extended in the future? Were there creative additional tools that supported your work. Was there something not covered in class that you were excited about, learned, and implemented anyway? (Document this to bring to my attention if so!)

You are expected to have at least one team member (ideally everyone) present the final project on the final presentation day of class.

\end{DoxyTable}


5\% (Documentation)

Did you generate something like "{}http\+://www.\+horde3d.\+org/docs/html/\+\_\+api.\+html"{}?

~\newline
 

5\% (Build)

Does the build work when I download your repo and run the game?

5\% (Post mortem)

Did you learn anything and provide a brief and well-\/thought out reflection of these learnings?

5\% (Website)

Do you have a webpage that presents your project in a positive way with the above materials.

{\bfseries{Note}}\+: If I get reports from all team members that someone did not do their fair share, I reserve the right to grade the entirety of that individual members project grade on a scale of 0-\/100 based on their contribution that will be separate from the rubric.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This would be a rare option I do not expect to use, but I want you to be good teammates to each other.
\item Being a good teammate means\+: Being responsive, not waiting to the last minute to contribute (and otherwise communicating why that may need to happen), and giving your best effort.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{dir_93f41424f6d5de1a74bca18dcb0bf554_autotoc_md50}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Notes on working in teams}{Notes on working in teams}}\label{dir_93f41424f6d5de1a74bca18dcb0bf554_autotoc_md50}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Pragmatically
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is useful to work in separate branches in git, and then merge your code to master, and then resolve the merge conflicts (ideally with the person you are working with).
\item If you are uncomfortable with this in github, then pair programming may be a viable option
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Note\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I do {\bfseries{need}} to see commits from everyone in the codebase. I do not grade based on \textquotesingle{}most commits\textquotesingle{} (In fact, one person may have 10x the commits as another and that\textquotesingle{}s fine) -- however, seeing no commits, or only commits at the very end of the project may require me to adjust your score if teammates report that you did not do your fair share in a timely manner.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item On working with others
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Be responsive
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Check your email, respond to your teammates within 24-\/48 hours on the preferred communication platform
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Be proactive
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Alert the course staff if there are issues sooner rather than later--we cannot do anything the last day before the project is due.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Contribute
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The course staff looks at the commit logs to make sure everyone participated (No free rides--earn your grade!)
\item Note\+: One team member doing all the work is not heroic either
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Balance the work load--no one should complete more than 50\% of the project on a 4 person team for example.
