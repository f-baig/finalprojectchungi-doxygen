\item At this point in the project, your goal is to have a prototyped version of your game (Some skeleton or minimum viable product (MVP)).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You should not be guessing what you are making, but have otherwise decided what you are going to make (e.\+g. "{}\+A 2\+D platformer like Mario"{}, or "{}\+A flying space game"{}).
\item The rubric otherwise states that we see at least \textquotesingle{}1 commit\textquotesingle{} (perhaps the framework of your engine) indicating you have started the project.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item You will also start documenting your code, so that your teammates can otherwise understand the work that you are doing.
\item During this stage, you may also be simultaneously be working on some of the tooling.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For example, if you know you are making a \textquotesingle{}2D platformer\textquotesingle{} game, then you should otherwise delegate a team member to building the level editor, and perhaps agreeing on the output format of that data.

Now that you are going to be maintaining the code for \textquotesingle{}your game company\textquotesingle{} for many years (and working in a team), it is important to properly document your code. You can use either Doxygen or \textquotesingle{}DDoc\textquotesingle{} \href{https://dlang.org/spec/ddoc.html}{\texttt{(DDoc)}} to document the source code and automatically generate .html pages. Your documentation should cover your classes and functions.

\item[\DoxyUnchecked] A small prototype of your game engine, we effectively check this off if you have at least 1-\/commit of code in your repository.

There is some expectation that some of your final projects may actually develop and be released into commercial games over time. It is thus important to start the documentation process early enough, that if you decide to revisit this project, you will have a better chance at success with understanding your code. Regardless, documentation is important, especially documenting the \textquotesingle{}why\textquotesingle{} and overall architecture of a project.\hypertarget{dir_f7339d3bd0b25976a4cfeef8fdcb2d02_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{More resources on documenting code}{More resources on documenting code}}\label{dir_f7339d3bd0b25976a4cfeef8fdcb2d02_autotoc_md24}
