The feature complete version, just a few bug fixes and final touches before release! \end{quote}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item At this point, you should have a game that is prototyped, and perhaps some primitive tooling.
\item It is now time to continue working on the game and to start generating the required minimum of 3 scenes in your game.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Your team may at this time be otherwise doing refactoring of the engine to make it more data-\/driven, and otherwise taking time to clean up the code and fix bugs.
\item After the beta stage of your project, your project should generally be \textquotesingle{}feature complete\textquotesingle{} as far as what you are trying to do with the engine.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tooling, GUI\textquotesingle{}s, etc. however may continuously add features and polish -- this is another advantage of seperating the engine from the tooling.

0 For your final project deliverable you will be creating a website that you can host on your portfolio. I might recommend peeking at the last portion of this project, and otherwise consider a free host like \textquotesingle{}github pages\textquotesingle{} -- see \href{https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site}{\texttt{Creating a Github Pages Site}}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You should create your website, and place a link to the 30 second video (see deliverables below) on your website showing the early progress under the headline \textquotesingle{}30-\/second progress video\textquotesingle{}.
\item Please place a link to your website on the engine \href{../Engine}{\texttt{../\+Engine}} page otherwise.
\item Note\+: I recommend uploading your 30 second video to You\+Tube, Google Drive, or Vimeo so that it will persist. Please make sure I can view the video (i.\+e. make sure it is not private, and you can view it without being logged in).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item[\DoxyUnchecked] You should have a github pages site (or some other webhost) with at the least a link on the website to your video describing your progress.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This does not have to be a fancy website, but otherwise you should establish having a website hosted somewhere with a link to your video.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item[\DoxyUnchecked] You should have a short video (\texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}30 seconds) of your progress on your game and your editor.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Your video may show you generating some data (e.\+g. a level) in a level editor, and then that data being loaded into your game engine. It does not need to be feature complete, but otherwise I need to see that you have otherwise made progress on your project (e.\+g. the graphics, having a pipeline of getting data into your game engine, etc.)
